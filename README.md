## Run Project Locally

Open `index.html` in a web browser to run the project locally.

Hearthstone Wiki has some info on [deck importing](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Deck_Importing) which includes how to copy a deck from within Hearthstone. Make sure to paste the full text of what was copied and not just the code for the deck into Hearthstone Deck Saver.

## FAQs 

Q: Why create this app?  

A: In Hearthstone, you can only save 18 decks, but you might want to quickly save some decks that you don't use too often, such as decks that help you fulfill a quest like playing a certain number of dragons, or cards with battlecries, etc. 

Q: Why can I only access my saved decks with the browser that saved them? 

The app saves the data for your decks to local storage which means it is saved to a storage area in a particular browser and never gets transmitted over the internet to a server. Also, since it's saved to your browser, take care to not delete local storage. 

Q: Can I export or backup my deck data?

A: Not yet! Let me know if you're interested in that.
